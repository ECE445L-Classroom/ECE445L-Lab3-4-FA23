## 0 Repository Structure

The typical explanation for the repo structure. Lab specific instructions can be found further below.

### 0.1 HW

The `hw` folder should contain your schematic and board files for your PCB or circuits. In labs 1-5 and 10, you will be creating schematics for your circuit in EAGLE. A setup tutorial can be found [here](https://www.shawnvictor.net/autodesk-eagle.html).

### 0.2 SW

The `sw` folder should contain your application firmware and software written for the lab. The SW/inc folder contains firmware drivers written for you by Professor Valvano. Feel free to write your own (in fact, in some labs, you may be required to write your own).

You can place any other source files in the `sw/` folder. TAs will look at the files you create and/or modify for software quality and for running your project.

### 0.3 Resources

A couple files are provided in the Resources folder so you don't have to keep searching for that one TI document. Some of them are immediately useful, like the TM4C datasheet. Others may be useful for your final project, like the TM4C_System_Design_Guidelines page.

### 0.4 Git and Github

We will extensively use Git and Github for managing lab projects. This makes it easier for TAs to grade and help debug the project by allowing us to see commit histories, maintain a common project structure, and 
Likewise, it makes it easier for students to collaborate with partners, merge different codebases, and to debug their work by having a history of commits.

Two common ways of using Git and Github are [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) and the [command line](https://git-scm.com/downloads). [Tutorials](https://dev.to/mollynem/git-github--workflow-fundamentals-5496) are also abundant on the net for you to peruse. We've provided a cheatsheet for git in the Resources folder.

It is highly recommended to make the most out of Git, even if you've never used it before. Version control will save you a lot of suffering, and tools like Git or SVN are ubiquitous in the industry.

A gitignore file is added to the root of this repo that may prevent specific files from being tagged to the repo. This are typically autogenerated output files we don't care about, but sometimes other stuff (like .lib files) falls through that we want. Feel free to modify if necessary.

## 1 Summary

### 1.1 Background
**WiFi** is the name given to devices that communicate wirelessly employing the IEEE 802.11 standard. They typically operate in the 2.4 GHz Industrial-Scientific-Medical (ISM) unlicensed band that is shared with ZigBee (IEEE 802.15.4) and Bluetooth (IEEE 802.15.1) communications.  The IEEE 802.11 standard describes how information is represented via radio frequency signals, i.e., the **physical** or **PHY** layer, and how communications are formatted and controlled, 
* i.e. the media access control or MAC layer. 
Communication requirements beyond the PHY and MAC
* e.g. flow control, error recovery, and routing, are handled at higher levels of the internet stack. 

### 1.2 Required Hardware
| Part Number       | Device Function   | Source                        | Price     |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------- | --------- |
| ESP8266           | WiFi module       | from TA                       | $3.50     |
| ST7735            | LCD module        | yours                         | $19.99    |
| EK-TM4C123GXL     | TiVa LaunchPad    | yours                         | $12.99    |
| Any analog sensor |                   | find it yourself (optional)   |           |
| LM2937-3.3        | 3.3V regulator    | from EER checkout desk        | $1.68     |

### 1.3 Specifications
This lab will create a “smart object” that connects to your smart phone via the [Blynk](https://blynk.io/) application. Your system includes:
* A PC, running [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/), connected to the TM4C123 through UART0 (strongly suggested for debugging)
* A TM4C123 LaunchPad running your software
* An ESP8266 WiFi module that is configured with the Blynk ESP8266 WiFi code.
* A ST7735R or any LCD showing the time
* Use Lab 2 code to record incoming messages and outgoing jitter.
* The minimum requirements are to be able to set time, set alarm, and visualize the time from the phone. There must be at least 3 displays (hour, minute, second) and 3 buttons.
* Measure an external sensor using the ADC (extra credit). Any external sensor and any interface method is ok (ADC, I2C, or SPI).

*NOTE: You will need access to a wireless access point, configured with or without security.*
